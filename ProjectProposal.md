# Project proposal for *YOUR PROJECT TITEL*
Author: *Adam D'Andrea*

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 2pts

I would like to try implimenting my new machine learning knowledge to a Kaggle competition dataset.

I doubt I will submit my results to the competition, but it would still be a great learning experience to try to apply my new knowledge.

My main goal, is to reinforce my learning from class with a new kaggle competition data set.

## 2. How: Plan of attack 2pts

I plan to impliment various techniques learned from the labs within class, as this will help reinforce what I have learned.

Overall, I would like to impliment a couple different machine learning techniques to try to predict the outcome of test data, using grid searching, fitting and training models with training data and then comparing their results to test data.

I love figures, so I will do my best to impliment as many usefil figures as I can, including confusion matrixes.

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts

The kaggle competition I would like to work on is: "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disasters"

Kaggle URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

The data set includes features such as Age, Sex, Siblings, Parents, Ticket#, Dare, Cabin#, Port of Embarkation, Ticket Class, and the goal is to predict the survival.

theory used: pre-processing-onehotencoder, grid search with randomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier, confusion matrix.
